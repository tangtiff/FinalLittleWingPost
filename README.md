[![Little Wing Post - DEMO](https://img.youtube.com/vi/1Hd6urxKS74/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hd6urxKS74)

Developed by Brian Yu, Adora Wu, Tiffany Tang, and Ian Tsai for CSE 457 Final Artifact, 2025.

This is a third person Unity-based game focused on collection and delivery. Players find lost packages scattered throughout town and deliver them to the right mailboxes. Around the island, dogs will chase you down, applying setbacks to the player by knockback, stealing packages, or depleting the timer. The player's goal is to successfully deliver five packages to their destination before the timer runs out!
